<h1>MaxScore Basics 1</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>MaxScore consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) and an application program interface (API).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The MaxScore object is an API and it has the role of the brain of MaxScore. If you would like to get to know the MaxScore object go here: ...</li>
<li>The <i>MaxScore.Editor</i> is the visual part of MaxScore or a GUI and it is designed for editing MaxScore scores directly in a Max Window.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this tutorial we will focus on the <i>MaxScore.Editor</i> and examine its functions.</p>
<p>Lets start by opening Max.</p>
<p>There are two ways to start a score with the <i>MaxScore.Editor</i>.
First, use the <i>MaxScore.Editor</i> object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Editor window by clicking on the <i>Open Editor</i> button inside the bpatcher.</li>
<li>Or use a message box as the input order and connect it to the left inlet of the <i>MaxScore.Editor</i>.
By using the message <i>openWindow</i> and clicking on it, the Editor window will pop up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at the help file of <i>MaxScore.Editor</i>. Here you can find some additional messages, which can be found from the Dictionary. Go to the <i>Extras</i> section of the menu, find MaxScore and select <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>To start a new score, Go to <i>File</i> on the left corner of the window and choose <i>New Score</i>. By default, the tempo is set to 60 BPM, the time signature is a 4/4 and the clef is a G-clef.
To change this, go to <i>Tools</i> and chose the clef you want by clicking in the corresponding section. To modify the tonality (add sharps or minors) click on the <i>Key Signature</i> section on the right of the <i>Clef</i> section.</p>
<p>If you need to change the time signature, click on the <i>Meter</i> button right bellow the <i>Clef</i> button and type the numbers you wish in the window that appears. Use a gap between the two numbers (e.g for 3/4 type 3 4). Use the same procedure for adjusting the tempo by using the button right next to the <i>Meter</i> button.</p>
<p>In order to add notes double click or ctrl-click (Mac) or option-click (Windows) on the pentagram. If you want to transpose notes use cmd-drag (Mac) or ctrl-drag (Windows).</p>
<p>If you want to add rest notes, create a new note and then chose from the <i>Tools</i> first the note value and then the rest symbol (third symbol on the first row).</p>
<p>To add dynamics or articulation, select a note and then chose from the <i>Tools</i> bar the corresponding symbols. e.g for dynamics check the fifth column. If you wish to add a crescendo or decrescendo to your score, select the passage or notes and click the Crescendo or Decrescendo symbol from the Tools.</p>
<p>If you want to add tuplets, select the section or notes and then choose the corresponding symbols from the <i>Tools</i> bar (5th and 6th column, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)</p>
<p>To add repeats or barlines, select the measure and then click on the corresponding symbols at the bottom of the <i>Tools</i> bar.</p>

<p>You can always use the Shortcuts and work fast and efficiently. Go to <i>Edit</i> on the left corner of the window and choose <i>Shortcuts</i>. A window with all the different shortcuts will then pop up.
